## Assignment B1
```{r}
#Installing library
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)


```

### Excerise 1
Creating a function, doesn't have to be complex or serious. The function **should** be flexible. 
My idea is to create a function that will be able to group categories and calculate the mean as long as it is a _numeric variable_

```{r}

```


### Excerise 2
Document the function
```{r}


```


### Excerise 3
Examples of how this function may be used
```{r}


```


### Excerise 4
Testing the function 
```{r}


```
